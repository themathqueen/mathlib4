# Topological properties of units

This file contains lemmas about the topology of units in topological monoids,
including results about submonoid units and units of product spaces.

open Units

/-- If a submonoid is open in a topological monoid, then its units form an open subset
of the units of the monoid. -/
@[to_additive /-- If a submonoid is open in a topological additive monoid,
then its additive units form an open subset of the additive units of the monoid. -/]
